# Ultimate-Proxy-Scraper
This script scrapes a list of proxies from a user-specified URL. It defines various regex patterns to match IP addresses and ports in HTML responses from proxy sites. It then sends a request to the specified URL and attempts to extract proxies from the response using the defined patterns.
